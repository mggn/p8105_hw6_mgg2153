```

### Problem 2

```{r load_data}

bwt_df = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    mrace = as.factor(mrace),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    babysex = as.factor(babysex)
  )

sapply(bwt_df, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) #looks like there are no missing values, let's build a model
```
```{r my_model}

#model based on information from my thesis, give justification later :D

mg_model = lm(bwt ~ gaweeks+mrace+ppbmi, data = bwt_df)

mg_model %>% broom::tidy()

bwt_df %>%
  modelr::add_predictions(mg_model) %>%
  modelr::add_residuals(mg_model) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = resid, y = pred))+geom_point()+ #look back at regression notes :D
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    x = "Residuals",
    y = "Predicted values",
    title = "Residuals vs. predicted values", #yhat?
    caption = "Regression diagnostics"
  )


```
#### Model comparisons


```{r regression}

#main effects model

main_effect = lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = bwt_df)

main_effect %>% broom::tidy()


```

```{r}

#head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions
saturated = lm(bwt ~ bhead*blength*babysex, data = bwt_df)

saturated %>% broom::tidy()

```


### Problem 3

Wow this looks like a fun one
